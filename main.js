Themes:
- array - pushing elements in an array
- array - finding something within nested arrays
- counting the letters in a string - maybe with random symbols
- sum of two array elements - like kata from yesterday
- zombie border control - splitting into two arrays using pattern recognition

👉 Write your kata here!
 Scenario:
Oh, no a zombie virus has broken out but fortunately you live in the safehaven of Codeville. 

You are the border guard checking that the people entering are not infected with the zombie virus. You have a list of names of people and their details that want to enter Codeville. Look for any suspicious details that may suggest they are secretly infected!

//👉 Write the function your CodeWarriors will start with below here:

export function getHumans(entryList){
    // loop through array within object
    //name - just letters in the string
    // city - !== Zombieville
    // blood type should not have a Z in string
    // add personfile which has these requirements to array
//     // return array
    let humans = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < entryList.length; i++){
        let name = entryList[i].personfile.name 
        let pattern = /[^a-zA-Z]+/g;
        let result = pattern.test(name);
        let city = entryList[i].personfile.city;
        let bloodType = entryList[i].personfile.bloodType;
        let zPattern = /[zZ]+/g;
        let bloodResult = zPattern.test(bloodType);
            if ( result == false){
